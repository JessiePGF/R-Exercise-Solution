# R Exercise from《資料分析的統計學基礎--使用R語言》
I am studying R through 《資料分析的統計學基礎--使用R語言》.This book provides exercises but no official solutions, to enhance my understanding of statistics and R programming, I decided to write my own solutions and share them here.

# Content
- R scripts for exercise solutions from the book
- The repo only contains solutions to the exercises, not the example codes from the book.
- Some exercises also require hand writting , such as mathematical derivations. There are only the R programming parts here.

# Disclaimer
These solutions are my personal work, I can't ensure they're 100 % right. Also, there might be other more efficient way to solve the problems.Feedback and suggestions are always welcome!
